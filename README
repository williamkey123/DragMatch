# Herd Mentality 🐄

**Herd Mentality** is a casual puzzle game built in SwiftUI where players drag pairs of farm animals onto a 6×6 grid. Align three or more of the same animal in a row or column to clear them and keep the board from filling up!

## 🧠 Gameplay

- Drag randomly generated **pairs of animals** onto the board.
- Pairs can be **horizontal or vertical**.
- When **3 or more identical animals** align in a row or column, they **disappear**.
- The game **ends when the board is full** and there's no room for the next pair.

Your goal is to think ahead, plan your placements, and keep the grid alive as long as possible!

## 🎮 Features

- SwiftUI-based grid layout and drag interactions
- Four distinct animal types with cute, recognizable icons
- Automatic clearing of animal matches (3+ in a row/column)
- Game-over condition when no more moves are possible
- Designed for quick, replayable sessions

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI** (iOS 17+)
- Swift Concurrency and `@Observable` model architecture
- Designed with modular, testable components
